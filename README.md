### MacOS Metal SuperTerminal

**This is not a Unix terminal.**

I have a few favourite languages that I am slowly working on, Forth, NewBCPL, FasterBASIC, Scheme etc, and they need a user interface/runtime on the Mac.

I have never been able to get a grip on the Mac, and I want more of an interactive 1980s style experience, and less of a gui.

SuperTerminal is an editor and terminal that provides 1980s-1990s style 2D graphics and sound, of the kind I always wished I had on the computers I owned at the time.  Simple and easy to use.

This includes sound effects, music playback, several retro video modes with blitter and per line palettes, a seperate sprites layer, etc.

The closest we can get to the metal on the Unix mac is the metal API so this is used extensively, and turns out to be good fun.
